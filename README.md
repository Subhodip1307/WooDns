> üöÄ A lightweight, blazing-fast local DNS server written in Rust. Maps Docker container names to their internal IPs, and seamlessly forwards all other DNS queries to your upstream resolver.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- üîß **Resolve Docker container names** to their internal IPs instantly
- üåç **Automatic forwarding** of all other DNS queries to your upstream DNS (like 8.8.8.8)
- üê≥ No need to expose container ports to the host
- ‚ö° Built with Rust async for performance and reliability
- üõ†Ô∏è Easy integration via `/etc/resolv.conf` or `systemd-resolved`
- üì¶ Minimal dependencies, single binary

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status: In Development

This project is still under active development.  
**Bugs, missing features, or small issues may be present.**

> Contributions, bug reports, and suggestions are highly welcome!

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Download or Build

- **Option A: Download Compiled Binary (Linux x86_64)**
  
  [Download Latest Release](./WooDns-linux-amd64)

  ```sh
  chmod +x WooDns-linux-amd64
  ```

- **Option B: Build from Source**

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Subhodip1307/WooDns.git
  cd WooDns
  cargo build --release
  # The binary will be at target/release/woodns
  ```

---

### 2. Deploy with systemd

1. **Move the executable** to `/usr/local/bin/woodns`:

    ```sh
    sudo mv target/release/woodns /usr/local/bin/woodns
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/woodns
    ```

2. **Create a systemd service file:**

    ```ini
    # /etc/systemd/system/woodns.service
    [Unit]
    Description=WooDns Docker-aware local DNS server
    After=network.target docker.service

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/woodns
    # Change this to the user you want to run WooDns as
    User=woodns
    Group=woodns
    Restart=on-failure
    AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
    # To run on different address(optional), default address is 127.0.0.13
    # Environment="host=127.0.x.x"
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

3. **Permissions:**

    - The `User` specified (here, `woodns`) **must**:
      - Have execute permissions on `/usr/local/bin/woodns`
      - Have permissions to run Docker commands (typically by being in the `docker` group):
        ```sh
        sudo usermod -aG docker woodns
        ```
      - Own or have read access to any config files if you add them

4. **Enable and start:**

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable woodns
    sudo systemctl start woodns
    sudo systemctl status woodns
    ```

---

### 3. Point System DNS to WooDns

Edit `/etc/resolv.conf` (or your systemd-resolved drop-in):

```
syntax:  nameserver <dns_server_runing_address>
example: nameserver 127.0.0.13
```

> **Note:** Place WooDns at the top.

## üê≥ Demo: Resolving Docker Container Names

Once WooDns is running and your system points to it for DNS:

```sh
# List all running containers
docker container ls

# Example output:
# CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND                  NAMES
# a1b2c3d4e5f6   nginx:alpine "nginx -g 'daemon of‚Ä¶"   nginx_demo
# 2345f6a7b8c9   redis:alpine "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   redis_cache

# Copy a container name (e.g., nginx_demo) and ping it:
ping nginx_demo

# You should see replies from the container's internal IP!
```

---

## üîÑ Use Container Names in Host Applications

Thanks to WooDns, you can now use Docker container names **anywhere on your host machine** where a hostname is accepted, such as:

- **Nginx reverse proxy configs**:
    ```nginx
    upstream backend {
        server redis_cache:6379;  # Use the container name directly!
    }
    ```
- **Other application configs** (e.g., databases, microservices, etc.):
    ```
    host = nginx_demo
    ```

No more looking up or hardcoding container IPs‚Äîjust use the container name!

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- Resolves Docker container names to their IPs automatically.
- If a queried name is not a Docker container, WooDns forwards the request to your upstream DNS (e.g., 8.8.8.8).
- No need for port exposure or manual `/etc/hosts` editing.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Security

- **User permissions:** The systemd service must run as a user with permission to execute the WooDns binary and access Docker (usually by being in the `docker` group).
- **Port:** WooDns binds to `127.0.0.13:53` by default. Ensure nothing else is using this address/port.
- **Production:** WooDns is under active development. Test thoroughly before deploying in critical environments.
